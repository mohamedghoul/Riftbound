This pack contains a level map plus 8 decoration models to create a dungeon environment. Rooms are submeshes, thus it works well with the occlusion culling system. 
Also lightmapping resolution can be higher that way. Textures contain normal and spec maps.

NOTE: To get same look like in our video please use provided PostProcessing behaviour and add standard water.
